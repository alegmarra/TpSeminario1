Feature: grade student
  As a Professor
  I want to grade students based on submited code
  So that I can determine who's this week "winner"

--Output from Submited code is still private--
  #Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)
  Scenario: Submited code is still private          # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:8
    Given I'm in my home page
    And the class project already started
    When Students submit code
    Then Only me and my assistants can see the code

--Output from --
  Scenario:                                                           # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:14
    Given Only I can see everyones code
    And Student already started the project
    When Students flags it as finished
    Then a message should arrive to me and my assistants updates page
    And a proposed grade based on finishing time should be presented

--Output from Studen flags code as finished--
  Scenario: Studen flags code as finished                    # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:22
    Given Deadline not met yet
    And Code is still private
    When Me and my assistants recieve a notification message
    Then A link should lead me to the submited code page
    And A grading field based on quality should be enabled.

--Output from Estipulated deadline met--
  Scenario: Estipulated deadline met                  # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:29
    Given not all the students finished their project
    When deadline hour for this project arrives
    Then all projects get closed
    And no other submition is allowed

--Output from First stage completed--
  Scenario: First stage completed                   # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:35
    Given Deadline was met
    When Projects get closed for submitions
    Then all projects became public for peer review

--Output from Peer Review enabled--
  Scenario: Peer Review enabled                                       # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:40
    Given Every student can see its classmates code
    When one students grades somebody else's code
    Then ponderated grade is calculated based on the grader category.

--Output from Peer grade submitted--
  #Contribution on open questions, comments made graded positive (more on this later), grader average score, etc.
  #TODO obliged peer grading
  Scenario: Peer grade submitted                          # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:48
    Given Student graded peer's code
    When grade is ready to be public
    Then grader can add comments in Justification textBox

--Output from Peer graded Peer--
  Scenario: Peer graded Peer                      # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:53
    Given A peer grade was made public
    When the submitter confirms it
    Then Justification may be asked by code owner
    And Grader and Professor should be notified

--Output from Discussion deadline met--
  Scenario: Discussion deadline met                      # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:59
    Given Grading deadline is met
    When I ask for an average score of a particular code
    Then Ponderate average is calculated

--Output from Ponderated average calculation--
  Scenario: Ponderated average calculation                                  # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:64
    Given I click on "total average"
    When "grades by status" were calculated
    Then number of bugs found and  number of fixes should be ponderated too

--Output from project winner--
  Scenario: project winner                                             # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:69
    Given All grades were calculated
    When I asks for project top 3 students
    Then "Top 3" should be exposed with gold, silver and bronze medals

--Output from Project is closed--
  Scenario: Project is closed                          # ProfessorGradesStudents.feature:74
    Given a "winner" was proclaimed
    When a new project has started or course completed
    Then "comments" on previous code is enabled
    And code editing is disabled
