Title: Peer bug fixing and code editing

As a User
I want to edit someone else's code
So that I can fix/correct it

//Note: Should NOT be used to give a diferent version, to that porpouse
// 	exits each user on version of the project resolution.
//	Edition is meant to do minor modifications

Scenario 4: Peer Review enabled
Given Every student can see its classmates code
When  an error or bug is spoted
Then  Anyone can edit the code
And   Code author is notified

Scenario 5: Peer edited code
Given Someone edits another person's code
When The edition is saved
Then a new version is created
And  difference view between versions should be available
