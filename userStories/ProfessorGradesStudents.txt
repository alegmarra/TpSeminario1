Title: Professors grades students 
 
Narrative:
As a Professor
I want to grade students based on submited code
So that I can determine who's this week "winner"
 
#Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)
 
Scenario 1: Submited code is still private
Given Only I can see everyones code
  And Student already started the project
When  Students flags it as finished
Then  a message should arrive to my updates page
  And a proposed grade based on "finishing time" should be presented


Scenario 2: Studen flags code as finished
Given Deadline not met yet
And   Code is still private
When  I recieve a notification message
Then  A link should lead me to submited code page
And   A grading field based on quality should be enabled.

Scenario 3: Estipulated deadline met
Given not all the students finished their project
When  deadline hour arrives
Then  all projects get closed and no other submitions are alowed
And   all projects became public for peer review

Scenario 4: Peer Review enabled
Given Every student can see its classmates code
When  one students grades somebody else's code
Then  grade's made public
And   The real grade submited is calculated based on the
      grader "category". Contribution on open questions, 
      comments made graded positive (more on this later), 
      grader average score, etc.

Scenario 5: Peer graded Peer
Given A peer grade was made public
When  the submitter confirms it
Then  Justification may be asked by code owner
And   Grader and Professor should be notified

Scenario 6: Discussion deadline met
Given Time was given to every user to check other's code 
And   grades should be fixed so a new project starts
When  professor asks for an average score of a particular code
Then  Ponderate average is calculated based on wich peer gave the grade, 
      how many aprroved fixed were made and the professors grades.
And   project "winner" or "winners" is notified in updates page.

Scenario 7: Project is closed
Given a winner was proclaimed 
When a new project has started
Then comments on previous code is enabled
And  code editing is disabled
